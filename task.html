                    Fashnear Technologies Private Limited was established by IIT Delhi graduates Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal in December, 2015 as an on-demand delivery service like Swiggy but for fashion products from local shops. The startup failed. In 2016, the founders came up with the idea of re-establishing the platform as Meesho, one that would enable country-wide shipping for resellers with the use of social media sites as tools for marketing.
                    Meesho had 209,000 users and 1.2  orders per month in March It saw big growth during 2021 and 2022. Meesho's monthly transacting user count rose 26 times during 2020. Globally, Meesho mobile app was among the top most downloaded apps in 2021. In 2022, Meesho had about 120 million monthly users and about 910 million orders were made through the platform. It soon became one of India's fastest growing e-commerce platforms.Its gross 
                    merchandise value (GMV) increased ninefold in two years and was at about $5 billion in 2022 (for comparison, Flipkart's GMV stood at $23 billion).In 2023, Meesho was named one of the most influential companies of the year by Time (magazine).In the same year, Meesho also became the fastest shopping app to cross over 500 million downloads.
